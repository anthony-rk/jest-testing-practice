# jest-testing-practice

*This repository was to practice using Unit Testing with Jest as outlined by The Odin Project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice?ref=lnav*

**Functions that I have implemented in Javascript are the following:**
  1. **capitalizeString()**, which takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.

  2. **reverseString()**, which takes a string and returns it reversed.

  3. **calculator**, a calculator object that contains the basic mathematical operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.

  4. **Caesar Cipher**, which takes a phrase and an offset number and returns an encryption of the string. Read about it on this website: http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/

  5. **arrayAnalyze()**, which is a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
